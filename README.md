# General Chemistry
Study guide for general chemistry. 

Potential textbooks:
* [Chemistry 23, an OpenStax resource.](https://openstax.org/details/books/chemistry-2e)
* General Chemistry, The Essential Concepts, 7th ed., by Chang and Goldsby. 
* Chemistry, The Central Science, 14th ed., by Brown, LeMay, et. al. 

Additional resources could be found here: [https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/General_Chemistry](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/General_Chemistry). The outline is following Chang's textbook. The materials, mainly the figures and the questions, are adapted from wikipedia, OpenStax, and other open source resources.
