    "A **buffer solution** is a solution of (1) a weak acid or a weak base and (2) its salt. The solution has the ability to resist changes in $\\ce{pH}$ upon the addition of small amounts of either acid or base. \n",

    "Why a buffer solution can resist changes in $\\ce{pH}$?  \n",
    "Because both acid and base coexist in a buffer solution under equilibrium. The acid can react with any added $\\ce{OH-}$ and the base can react with any added $\\ce{H+}$.  \n",
