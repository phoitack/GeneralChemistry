    "## 1. Intermolecular Forces\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intermolecular forces** are attractive forces between molecules, also known as **Van der Waals forces**.  \n",
    "**Intramolecular forces** hold atoms together in a molecule, such as covalent bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactions Between Polar Molecules  \n",
    "**Polar covalent bonds** are covalent bonds between different atoms.  \n",
    "A **polar molecule** has a net dipole as a result of the opposing charges (i.e. having partial positive and partial negative charges) from polar bonds arranged asymmetrically.  \n",
    "Examples: $\\ce{HF}$, $\\ce{H2O}$  \n",
    "A **non-polar molecule** does not have net dipole either becaue there is no polar bond or because the polar bonds cancel each other.  \n",
    "Examples: $\\ce{H2}$, $\\ce{O2}$ which do not have polar bonds; $\\ce{CCl4}$ in which all polar bonds arranged symmetrically and cancel each other.  \n",
    "**Dipole-Dipole Forces** are attractive forces between polar molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactions Involves Non-Polar Molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dispersion Forces** are attractive forces that arise as a result of temporary dipoles induced in atoms or molecules.  \n",
    "**Polarizability** is the ease with which the electron distribution in the atom or molecule can be distorted. Polarizability increases with: greater number of electrons, and more diffuse electron cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dipole in the atom (or nonpolar molecule) is said to be an **induced dipole** because the separation of positive and negative charges in the atom (or nonpolar molecule) is due to the proximity of an ion or a polar molecule.  \n",
    "A nonpolar molecule interact with a polar molecule or an ion because of the induced dipole moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "An atom or a molecule can have all, most or majority of its electrons shifted to one side by random chance of the electron movements. When this happens a temporary dipole is created causing the side with more concentration of electrons to become more electronegative and the opposite relatively electropositive. This is called an **instantaneous dipole**.  \n",
    "Nonpolar molecules interact with each other due to the fact of the presence of instantaneous dipoles. This kind of interaction is called **London dispersion force**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Cases\n",
    "**Ion-Dipole Forces** are attractive forces between an ion and a polar molecule.  \n",
    "**Hydrogen Bonds** is a kind of special dipole-dipole interaction. A hydrogen bond is the electrostatic attraction between two polar groups that occurs when a hydrogen ($\\ce{H}$) atom covalently bound to a highly electronegative atom such as nitrogen ($\\ce{N}$), oxygen ($\\ce{O}$), or fluorine ($\\ce{F}$) experiences the electrostatic field of another highly electronegative atom nearby.  \n",
