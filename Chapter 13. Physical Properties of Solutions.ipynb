    "## 1. Some General Concepts and Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "A **solution** is a homogeneous mixture composed of two or more substances. There are six types of solutions (Table 13.1).  \n",
    "A **solute** is the minor component in a solution, dissolved in the solvent.  \n",
    "A **solvent** is a substance that dissolves a solute (a chemically different liquid, solid or gas), resulting in a solution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A **saturated solution** contains the maximum amount of a solute that will dissolve in a given solvent at a specific temperature.  \n",
    "An **unsaturated solution** contains less solute than the solvent has the capacity to dissolve at a specific temperature.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"info\"><b>Interesting Science</b>: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y3bKIOkcmk\" target=\"_blank\">Supersaturated solution.</a> </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "A **supersaturated solution** contains more solute than is present in a saturated solution at a specific temperature.  Supersaturation is achieved by dissolving a solute in one set of conditions, then transferring it to other conditions without triggering any release of the solute. Supersaturated solutions are extremely unstable, but often require a triggering event to begin returning to a stable state via the solute coming out of solution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Molecular view of solution formation** The formation of a solution involves the breaking of solvent-solvent interaction; the breaking of solute-solute interaction; and the formation of solvent-solute interaction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**exothermic** If the solute-solvent attraction is stronger than the solvent-solvent attraction and solute-solute attraction, the solution process is favorable; that is, it is exothermic ($\\Delta H_{soln} < 0$).  \n",
    "**endothermic** If the solute-solvent interaction is weaker than the solvent-solvent and solute-solute interactions, the solution process is endothermic ($\\Delta H_{soln} > 0$). Some endothermic processes still can happen because the formation of solution increases disorder.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Solubility** is a measure of the amount of a solute that will dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a specific temperature.  \n",
    "**Miscible:** When two liquids are completely soluble in each other in all proportions, as in this case, they are said to be miscible. Example, methanol & water.  \n",
    "**Solvation** is the process in which an ion or a molecule is surrounded by solvent molecules arranged in a specific manner. When the solvent is water, the process is called *hydration*.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Like dissolves like:** Two substances with similar intermolecular forces are likely to be soluble in each other.  \n",
    "* Non-polar molecules are soluble in non-polar solvents\n",
    "* Polar molecules are soluble in polar solvents\n",
    "* Ionic compounds are more soluble in polar solvents  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Temperature effect on the solubility of solids** With increasing temperature, some solid soludes have larger solubility, some lower. There is no clear correlation between the sign of $\\Delta H_{soln}$ and the variation of solubility with temperature.  \n",
    "**Temperature effect on the solubility of gases** Higher temperature always results in lower solubility.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pressure effect on the solubility of solids and liquids** No influence.  \n",
    "**Pressure effect on the solubility of gases** *Henry's Law* The solubility of a gas in a liquid is proportional to the pressure of the gas over the solution *assuming no chemical reaction occurs for solute and solvent*. If the solute reacts with the solvent, such as $\\ce{CO2}$ or $\\ce{NH3}$ in water, Henry's Law does not apply.  \n"
