    "\n",
    "1. A gas is composed of molecules that are separated from each other by distances far greater than their own dimensions.  The molecules can be considered to be points; that is, they possess mass but have negligible volume.\n",
    "2. Gas molecules are in constant motion in random directions, and they frequently collide with one another.  Collisions among molecules are perfectly elastic.\n",
    "3. Gas molecules exert neither attractive nor repulsive forces on one another.\n",
    "4. The average kinetic energy of the molecules is proportional to the temperature of the gas in kelvins.  Any two gases at the same temperature will have the same average kinetic energy\n",

    "Explanation of the gas laws \n",
    "\n",
    "* Compressibility of Gases. Because molecules in the gas phase are separated by large distances (assumption 1), gases can be compressed easily to occupy less volume.\n",
    "* Boyle's Law. The pressure exerted by a gas results from the impact of its molecules on the walls of the container. The collision rate, or the number of molecular collisions with the walls per second, is proportional to the number density (that is, number of molecules per unit volume) of the gas. Decreasing the volume of a given amount of gas increases its number density and hence its collision rate. For this reason, the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to the volume it occupies; as volume decreases, pressure increases and vice versa.\n",
    "* Charles's Law. Because the average kinetic energy of gas molecules is proportional to the sample's absolute temperature (assumption 4), raising the temperature increases the average kinetic energy. Consequently, molecules will collide with the walls of the container more frequently and with greater impact if the gas is heated, and thus the pressure increases. The volume of gas will expand until the gas pressure is balanced by the constant external pressure \n",
    "* Avogadro's Law. For two gases under the same conditions of pressure, volume, and temperature (that is, when $P_1 = P_2$, $T_1 = T_2$, and $V_1 = V_2$), it follows that $n_1 = n_2$, which is a mathematical expression of Avogadro's law.\n",
    "* Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures. If molecules do not attract or repel one another (assumption 3), then the pressure exerted by one type of molecule is unaffected by the presence of another gas. Consequently, the total pressure is given by the sum of individual gas pressures.\n",
