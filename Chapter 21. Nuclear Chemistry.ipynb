The resulting radiocarbon combines with atmospheric oxygen to form radioactive carbon dioxide, which is incorporated into plants by photosynthesis; animals then acquire $\\ce{^14C}$ by eating the plants. When the animal or plant dies, it stops exchanging carbon with its environment, and from that point onwards the amount of $\\ce{^14C}$ it contains begins to decrease as the $\\ce{^14C}$ undergoes radioactive decay. Measuring the amount of $\\ce{^14C}$ in a sample from a dead plant or animal such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone provides information that can be used to calculate when the animal or plant died. The older a sample is, the less $\\ce{^14C}$ there is to be detected, and because the half-life of $\\ce{^14C}$ is about 5,730 years, the oldest dates that can be reliably measured by radiocarbon dating are around 50,000 years ago.\n",

Otherwise, many of the neutrons will escape from the sample and the chain reaction will not occur. In this situation, the mass of the sample is said to be *subcritical*. When the amount of the fissionable material is equal to or greater than the **critical mass**, the minimum mass of fissionable material required to generate a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, most of the neutrons will be captured by uranium-235 nuclei, and a chain reaction will occur.\n",
